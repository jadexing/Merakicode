#Lists Active Clients on a network, the Meraki Client ID and MAC address
##Jamieinbox - Wi-Fi Cool Cats https://jamiegprice.substack.com/ CWNE #510
"""
This script is designed to interact with the Meraki API to list active clients on a network, including their Meraki Client ID, MAC address, and health scores. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Get API Key: It prompts the user to enter their Meraki API key.
Get Organizations: It makes an API call to retrieve a list of organizations associated with the provided API key.
Display Organizations: It prints the list of organizations to the screen.
Select Organization: It prompts the user to select an organization from the list.
Get Networks: It makes another API call to retrieve a list of networks within the selected organization. It handles pagination if there are multiple pages of networks.
Display Networks: It prints the list of networks to the screen.
Select Network: It prompts the user to select a network from the list.
Get Active Clients: It retrieves a list of clients within the selected network and filters only the active clients (those with status 'Online'). It handles pagination if there are multiple pages of clients.
Display Active Clients: It prints the list of active clients, including their Meraki Client ID, MAC address, and health scores.
Save Data to CSV: It saves the client data into a CSV file with the current date and time in the filename.
Calculate Runtime: It calculates and prints the runtime of the script in minutes and seconds.
The API endpoints it uses are:

Organizations API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations
Networks API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/networks
Network Clients API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/networks/{network_id}/clients
The script captures various details about each active client, such as client name, Meraki Client ID, MAC address, and health score. It then saves this data into a CSV file for further analysis.
