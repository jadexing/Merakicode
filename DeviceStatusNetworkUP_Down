Summary of What the Code Does:
This code connects to Cisco Meraki's API to check the status of access points (APs) in a selected organization. 
Device Data Retrieval: Pulls a list of devices and their statuses from the organization.
Dormant Devices Identification: Marks devices as "dormant" if they havenâ€™t reported in within a specified time frame.
Device Status Display: Displays a list of all devices in alphabetical order by name, along with their statuses (e.g., alerting, offline, dormant, online).
Status Counts: Counts and displays the number of APs in each status category (alerting, offline, dormant, online).
Offline APs: Lists all offline APs separately and provides a count of these.
Timestamp: Prints a timestamp at the end of the output to show when the report was generated.
This code helps network administrators get a comprehensive status overview of all APs in an organization, quickly identifying any that are alerting, dormant, or offline.
