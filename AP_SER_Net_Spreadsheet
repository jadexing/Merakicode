"""
This code is designed to interact with the Meraki API to retrieve and display information about access points (APs) within an organization, and then save this data into a spreadsheet. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Get API Key: It prompts the user to enter their Meraki API key.
Get Organizations: It makes an API call to retrieve a list of organizations associated with the provided API key.
Display Organizations: It prints the list of organizations to the screen.
Select Organization: It prompts the user to select an organization from the list.
Get Networks: It makes another API call to retrieve a list of networks within the selected organization.
Display Networks: It prints the list of networks to the screen, sorted alphabetically by their names.
Get Access Points: For the selected network, it retrieves the list of devices and filters out the access points (APs).
Display Access Points: It prints the details of each access point (name and serial number) to the screen, sorted alphabetically by their names.
Save Data to Spreadsheet: It saves the access point data into an Excel spreadsheet using pandas.
Calculate Job Duration: It calculates and prints the duration of the job.
The APIs it pulls from are:

Organizations API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations
Networks API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/networks
Devices API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/networks/{network_id}/devices
