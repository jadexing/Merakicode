"""
This code is designed to interact with the Meraki API to retrieve and aggregate client counts per access point (AP) for specific networks within an organization. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Get API Key: It prompts the user to enter their Meraki API key.
Get Organizations: It makes an API call to retrieve a list of organizations associated with the provided API key.
Select Organization: It automatically selects the first organization from the list.
Get Networks: It makes an API call to retrieve a list of networks within the selected organization.
Get Clients per AP: For each network, it retrieves the list of devices and then makes another API call to get the client count for each AP (access point) in the last 5 minutes.
Aggregate Data: It stores the client counts in a global dictionary, aggregated_data, and checks if any AP has a client count of 30 or more.
Display Results: It prints the APs with client counts over 30 to the screen.
Create Excel File: It creates an Excel file using openpyxl and populates it with the aggregated data, including network name, time, AP name, and client count.
Save Excel File: It saves the Excel file with a unique name based on the current date and time.
The APIs it pulls from are:

Organizations API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations
Networks API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/networks
Devices API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/networks/{network_id}/devices
Clients API: https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/devices/{device_serial}/clients?timespan=300
